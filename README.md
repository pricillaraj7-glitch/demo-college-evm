# demo-college-evm
This project is a client-side EVM simulation built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports sequential multi-voter input, localStorage-based vote persistence, realistic UI feedback, and admin-restricted result access. The system ensures vote secrecy and cross-device accessibility via online hosting.
